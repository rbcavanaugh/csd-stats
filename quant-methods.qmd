## Mixed-effects models

For better or worse, the bread and butter of psycholinguistic and other CSD research. Conceptually fantastic, but often tricky to implement *well*. My suggestion is to start with the first link below, and then pick an introductory paper to read and go through examples (e.g., Brown 2021). Then, if you're feeling good about things, I highly suggest working through the examples in Debruine & Barr (2021). Then go apply what you've learned to your own data. Then, when you're feeling really accomplished, write it up for publication, incorporating recommendations from Meteyard & Davies (2020) as you write. Or take a class at your institution. Or take one of the workshops linked below.

## Bayesian statistics

You should learn how to do Bayesian stats. If you've never tried to use bayes, I promise it's more intuitive than you think. And because of modern computing and R packages like {brms}, its arguably just as easy to implement as frequentist mixed models. If you know how to use lme4, then you're already 75% of the way to using {brms}.
