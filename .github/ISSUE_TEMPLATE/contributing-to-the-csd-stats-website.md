**The link or reference you would like to add**

[link/citation here]

**What section it belongs to (or propose a new one!)**

[name of section]

**How you found it useful**

[description of usefulness]

**Whether you would like to be acknowledged as a contributor**

[yes/no]

Or if you want to be really fancy you can create a pull request for the README (but also include these 3 things in the comment box). Also if any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource.
