**Contributing**

Please contribute!! Here's how: 

Go open an issue at the top of this github repository (the "issues" tab) and include 3 things: 

1. a link or reference
2. which section it belongs in
3. and how you found it useful

If any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource. 








**Reminder to self:** Here's the command to update the website
```
