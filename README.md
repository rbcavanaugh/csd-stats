# Statistics resources for the CSD researcher

Resources are located here: https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/csd-stats

**Contributing**

Please contribute!! Here's how: 

Go open an issue at the top of this github repository (the "issues" tab) and include 3 things: 

1. a link or reference
2. which section it belongs in
3. and how you found it useful

Or if you want to be really fancy you can create a pull request for the README (but also include these 3 things in the comment box). Also if any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource. 








**Reminder to self:** Here's the command to update the website
```
