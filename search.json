    "text": "This is a repository for resources related to learning and doing statistics and data analysis and open science and using R and other important things collected for (but certainly not limited to) new and seasoned researchers in the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Before you get bogged down in this overwhelming list of resources, I suggest you entertain yourself with this highly enjoyable scientific article (or at least listen to it during your commute this week, there is an audio version narrated by the authors) and remember that your goal is to do science, and these are just tools you might find useful along the way.\nhttps://www.experimental-history.com/p/things-could-be-better\nThese resources are generally based on R, but this is mostly because its what I was trained in, what I know the most about, and probably the scripted language used most often in CSD research. Python is cool too sometimes. I wish I knew Julia. (But if you asked me which additional language I thought researchers might find useful on top of R…its probably SQL…unless you’re thinking about an alt-ac career, in which case its definitely python…and SQL…but really once you know one of these fairly well its easy enough to pick up the others. Also you should probably learn some very basic git.).\nAnyways, point is that this list is for R but its not an exclusive endorsement of R. Perhaps someone will add a section for Python and Julia. If you really don’t want to learn a scripted/statistical language like R (or python, Julia, SQL…), then I suggest you go check out JASP, which is a free and open-source GUI build on top of R."

    "section": "Getting started",
    "text": "Getting started\nMy recommendation is that you use this list of resources in a very ad-hoc fashion. Some of the sections I have ordered so that the resource I find myself recommending most often for the total notice is at the top (indicated with an asterisk). Others are just lists of resources or people that I have learned a great deal from and that I think you might find useful. But if they’re on this list, then minimally I have found them helpful at some point or another.\nContributing\nPlease contribute!! Here’s how:\nGo open an issue in the github repository (the “issues” tab) and include 3 things:\n\na link or reference\nwhich section it belongs in\nand how you found it useful\n\nOr if you want to be really fancy you can create a pull request for the README (but also include these 3 things in the comment box). Also if any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource.\nContributors:\n\nYour name could be here!\n\nA word of advice\nLearning R or any of the stats below, especially for anyone who has never written any code before, can be a daunting task. But it is a skill that is worth learning. The best way to learn R is to use it. The best way to use it is to have a project that you need to use it for. The resources below are fantastic - but I highly suggest you use them in tandem with a project you are highly motivated to do in R. For example, you do a few chapters or sections of one of these resources, then you go try to apply that knowledge in your own project and with your own data.\nDisclosure: github co-pilot wrote most of this section, and I think its pretty spot on, and based on how I understand LLM’s to work, then probably this is the most common advice for learning R, or programming languages, or whatever the internet is saying about learning these days.\nAlso, its really helpful to have a mentor who knows a little bit more R or stats than you, even if only to check in with occasionally or give yourself some external accountability. If you don’t have that person, then its worth spending the time and effort to go find them (small plug for ASHA’s MARC program, which I have benefited greatly from, and the many mentors who have and continue to help me learn).\nA word of caution\nI have not proofread this page closely and you have probably realized by now that it’s full of run-on sentences and inconsistent punctuation and grammar and the like.\n\nI hope you find this useful ~ Rob"

Then, if you’re feeling good about things, I highly suggest working through the examples in Debruine & Barr (2021). Then go apply what you’ve learned to your own data. Then, when you’re feeling really accomplished, write it up for publication, incorporating recommendations from Meteyard & Davies (2020) as you write. Or take a class at your institution.
