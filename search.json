I wish I knew Julia.\n(But if you asked me which additional language I thought researchers might find useful on top of R…its probably SQL…unless you’re thinking about an alt-ac career, in which case its definitely python…and SQL…but really once you know one of these fairly well its easy enough to pick up the others. Also you should probably learn some very basic git.).\nAnyways, point is that this list is for R but its not an exclusive endorsement of R. Perhaps someone will add a section for Python and Julia.

    "section": "Getting started",
    "text": "Getting started\nMy recommendation is that you use this list of resources in a very ad-hoc fashion. Some of the sections I have ordered so that the resource I find myself recommending most often for the total notice is at the top (indicated with an asterisk). Others are just lists of resources or people that I have learned a great deal from and that I think you might find useful. But if they’re on this list, then minimally I have found them helpful at some point or another.\nIf you don’t see what you’re looking for, please consider asking for suggestions or recommendations on the discussions page (Yes, you will have to make a github account. It’s free. Students get extra perks and so do faculty).\nContributing\nPlease contribute!! Here’s how:\nGo open an issue in the github repository (the “issues” tab) and include 3 things:\n\na link or reference\nwhich section it belongs in\nand how you found it useful\n\nIf any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource.\nContributors:\n\nYour name could be here!\n\nA word of advice\nLearning R or any of the stats below, especially for anyone who has never written any code before, can be a daunting task. But it is a skill that is worth learning. The best way to learn R is to use it. The best way to use it is to have a project that you need to use it for. The resources below are fantastic - but I highly suggest you use them in tandem with a project you are highly motivated to do in R. For example, you do a few chapters or sections of one of these resources, then you go try to apply that knowledge in your own project and with your own data.\nDisclosure: github co-pilot wrote most of this section, and I think its pretty spot on, and based on how I understand LLM’s to work, then probably this is the most common advice for learning R, or programming languages, or whatever the internet is saying about learning these days.\nAlso, its really helpful to have a mentor who knows a little bit more R or stats than you, even if only to check in with occasionally or give yourself some external accountability. If you don’t have that person, then its worth spending the time and effort to go find them (small plug for ASHA’s MARC program, which I have benefited greatly from, and the many mentors who have and continue to help me learn).\nA word of caution\nI have not proofread this page closely and you have probably realized by now that it’s full of run-on sentences and inconsistent punctuation and grammar and the like.\n~ Rob"

Then, if you’re feeling good about things, I highly suggest working through the examples in Debruine & Barr (2021). Then go apply what you’ve learned to your own data.
