title: "Statistics Resources for the Rehabilitation Researcher"

[*Note: Originally, this website was focused on quantitative methods commonly used by research in Communication Science and Disorders, but I've made an effort to expand the focus to include rehabilitation research more brodaly (i.e., PT/OT and other allied health fields)*]{.aside}

This is a repository for resources related to learning and doing statistics and data analysis and open science and using R and other important things. These resources have been curated for (but certainly not limited to) new and seasoned researchers in rehabilitation research and related fields.

Before you get bogged down in this overwhelming list of resources, I suggest you entertain yourself with this highly enjoyable scientific article (or at least listen to it during your commute this week, there is an audio version narrated by the authors) and remember that your goal is to do science, and these are just tools you might find useful along the way.

## Getting started

My recommendation is that you use this list of resources in a very ad-hoc fashion. Some of the sections I have ordered so that the resource I find myself recommending most often for the total notice is at the top (indicated with an asterisk). Others are just lists of resources or people that I have learned a great deal from and that I think you might find useful. But if they're on this list, then minimally I have found them helpful at some point or another.

If you don't see what you're looking for, please consider asking for suggestions or recommendations on the [discussions page](https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/csd-stats/discussions) (Yes, you will have to make a github account. It's free. Students get [extra perks](https://education.github.com/pack) and [so do faculty](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application)). 

## A word of advice

These resources are generally based around the statistical programming language R, but this is mostly because its what I was trained in, what I know the most about, and probably the scripted language used most often in CSD research. Python is cool too sometimes. I wish I knew Julia. Perhaps someone will add a section for Python and Julia. If you really don't want to learn a scripted/statistical language like R (or python, Julia, SQL...), then I suggest you go check out [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org), which is a free and open-source GUI build on top of R.

Learning R or any of the stats below, especially for anyone who has never written any code before, can be a daunting task. But it is a skill that is worth learning. The best way to learn R is to use it. The best way to use it is to have a project that you need to use it for. The resources below are fantastic - but I highly suggest you use them in tandem with a project you are highly motivated to do in R. For example, you do a few chapters or sections of one of these resources, then you go try to apply that knowledge in your own project and with your own data.

[*Disclosure: github co-pilot wrote most of this section, and I think its pretty spot on, and based on how I understand LLM's to work, then probably this is the most common advice for learning R, or programming languages, or whatever the internet is saying about learning these days.*]{.aside}

Also, its *really* helpful to have a mentor who knows a little bit more R or stats than you, even if only to check in with occasionally or give yourself some external accountability. If you don't have that person, then its worth spending the time and effort to go find them (small plug for ASHA's [MARC](https://www.asha.org/students/mentoring/marc/) program, which I have benefited greatly from, and the many mentors who have and continue to help me learn).

**A word of caution**

I have not proofread this site closely and you have probably realized by now that it's full of run-on sentences and inconsistent punctuation and grammar and the like.


## Contributing

Please contribute!! You don't need to be an expert in stats/quantitative methods. In fact, I'm particularly keen on learning what resources are helpful for students who are learning (re rediscovering) statistics. 

Here's how: 

Go open an issue in the [github repository](https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/csd-stats) (the "issues" tab) and include 3 things: 

1. a link or reference
2. which section it belongs in
3. and how you found it useful

If any links are broken or out of date, the github issues are a good place to let me know that so I can fix it or delete the resource.
